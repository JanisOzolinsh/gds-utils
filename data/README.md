### IATA Zones: iata_zones.json

The file contains codified version of Travelport's APF system definition of so called "IATA Zones" (not Traffic Conference Areas).

Scrapped it by hand using wikipedia and https://www.agencyprivatefares.travelport.com/WebHelp/Default.htm#IATA_Zones.htm?Highlight=iata%20zones

Some military air bases and small islands, as well as locations without an airport are left out as plain `skippedNames` field
